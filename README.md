# Exhibit
Exhibit, previously known as "MDM Image Viewer", is a managed screensaver App for tvOS (made by the University of Nebraska) and a great alternative for conference rooms and public spaces where managed Apple TVs are locked to Conference Room Display mode. With Exhibit, you can customize the Apple TVs in your collaborative spaces by displaying curated images and videos to your users. The App also displays an AirPlay box similar to Conference Room Display mode so users can easily identify the device.

This GitHub Repo is a place for hosting Millikin University's custome theme used by this application.
